- [Offensive_text_detection.ipynb]([path/to/your/file/Offensive_text_detection.ipynb](https://github.com/nnikolovskiii/deep-learning-lab-exercises/blob/master/nlp/Offensive_text_detection.ipynb)): Detection of offensive text, classification problem with two classes (0 - not offensive, 1 - offensive). Using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers (not using the common Attention architecture). The loss is computed by BCEWithLogitsLoss which has inside of it a Sigmoid layer for performing the classification.
- [Shakespere_to_modern.ipynb](https://github.com/nnikolovskiii/deep-learning-lab-exercises/blob/master/nlp/2_Shakespere_to_modern.ipynb): Implementing a full Transformer architecture from the paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf). Implementing an encoder-decoder architecture that converts sentences from Shakespearean English to modern English. Also training a pre-trained encoder-decoder model (Bart) on the same data.
- [Prompting.ipynb](https://github.com/nnikolovskiii/deep-learning-lab-exercises/blob/master/nlp/3_Prompting.ipynb): Performing zero-shot and few-shot model training.
- [Knowledge_based.ipynb](https://github.com/nnikolovskiii/deep-learning-lab-exercises/blob/master/nlp/4_Knowledge_based.ipynb): Enhacing Large Language Models with knowledge for multi-choice question answering.
